# Project Name: Garden Path Sentence Analysis with spaCy

Description
This project demonstrates the use of the spaCy open-source library for Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze and tokenize garden path sentences. Garden path sentences are sentences that initially lead a reader to interpret them in one way but then require them to reanalyze what they have read as more information is revealed. The project showcases the tokenization and named entity recognition capabilities of spaCy.
